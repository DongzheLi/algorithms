# Missing int:

Given an input file with four billion one-negative integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer that is not contained in the file. Assume you have 1Gb memory available for this task

What if you only have 10Mb memory. Assume that all the values are distinct and we now have no more than one billion non-negative integers.
